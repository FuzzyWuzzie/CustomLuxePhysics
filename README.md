# CustomLuxePhysics

This is a small demo showing how you can create custom physics engines for use in [Luxe](http://luxeengine.com/). It doesn't do much, other than use the Minkowski Difference to prevent your player from falling through the platform (not doing swept collisions however). Use <kbd>w</kbd> to jump (naively).
